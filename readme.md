# Fishify

Interact with the spotify api through discord. Heavily WIP!

I have [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd) running on a raspberry pi attached to a speaker. 

TODO:
implement queue locally and play when song ends, have the pi send a command every time music ends
fix skip vote system
possibly migrate to poise? it seems simpler but may not be worth it
