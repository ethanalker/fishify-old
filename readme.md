# Fishify

[MOVED](https://git.ealker.com/ealker/fishify)

Interact with the spotify api through discord. Heavily WIP!

I have [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd) running on a raspberry pi attached to a speaker. 

TODO:  
clean up commands, (pause/resume is awkward, refactor/combine others)  
add command to show context of what is playing (album/playlist etc)  
make command able to see nexts song up to play (not sure if possible, may have to see what we can do with local queue system)  
implement queue locally and play when song ends, have the pi send a command every time music ends  
fix skip vote system  
possibly migrate to poise? it seems simpler but may not be worth it
